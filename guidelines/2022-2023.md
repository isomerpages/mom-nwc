# NATIONAL WAGES COUNCIL (NWC) 2022/2023 GUIDELINES
1.	The National Wages Council (“NWC”) convened in September and October 2022 to formulate wage guidelines for the period from 1 December 2022 to 30 November 2023.
### Economic Performance and Outlook
2.	Based on advance estimates[^1], the Singapore economy grew by 4.4% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis in the third quarter of 2022, easing slightly from the 4.5% growth in the previous quarter. This brought Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the first three quarters of the year to 4.3% y-o-y. Growth was broad-based, with the real value-added of most sectors of the economy having recovered to exceed their pre-pandemic levels.[^2] In line with the economic expansion, the labour market improved in the first three quarters of 2022 as resident employment grew and resident unemployment continued to ease. Retrenchments also fell to a record low. Meanwhile, labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, improved by 1.5% on a y-o-y basis in the first half of 2022.
3.	Due to strong external inflationary pressures, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) - All Items inflation is projected to average around 6% in 2022, higher than the 2.3% recorded in 2021. MAS Core Inflation (which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport) is projected to average around 4%, higher than the 0.9% in 2021.
4.	The Ministry of Trade and Industry (“MTI”) has projected that the Singapore economy will expand by “3% to 4%” in 2022. While GDP growth for the rest of the year is expected to be supported by a continued recovery in aviation- and tourism-related as well as consumer-facing sectors with the lifting of border and domestic restrictions, the outlook for outward-oriented sectors has weakened due to softening external demand. At the same time, downside risks in the global economy remain significant. These include escalations in the Russia-Ukraine conflict which could worsen global supply disruptions, intensified financial stability risks, escalations in regional geopolitical tensions, and a potential worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic situation again. Looking ahead to 2023, MTI expects Singapore’s GDP growth to moderate further in tandem with the projected slowdown of the global economy.[^3]
### Wage Increases Should be Fair and Sustainable, and Based on the Flexible Wage System (FWS)
5.	In line with economic growth and the improvement in labour productivity, the NWC calls on employers to reward employees with wage increases or variable payments that are fair. Employers should recognise the contributions of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, where some employees experienced wage cuts and freezes, and supported other cost-cutting measures. At the same time, the uncertainties ahead continue to underscore the need for resilience and flexibility in wage structures. The NWC therefore also calls on all employers who have not yet done so to implement the FWS. The NWC sets out the following wage guidelines for all employers:
	**a.	Employers that have done well and have good business prospects should reward their employees with built-in wage increases and variable payments commensurate with the employers’ performance and employees’ contributions.
	b.	Employers that have done well but face uncertain business prospects may exercise moderation in built-in wage increases, but should still reward employees with variable payments commensurate with the employers’ performance and employees’ contributions.
	c.	Employers that have not done well may exercise wage restraint, with management leading by example. These employers should make greater efforts to improve business processes and productivity, especially by investing in upskilling their employees. Employers that have not done well but face good business prospects may also consider setting out future variable payments that are linked to appropriate business indicators.**
6.	The adoption of the FWS will help employers in implementing the wage guidelines above, by making full use of variable wage components. Employers that have not yet adopted the FWS, or who need to build up the variable wage components to recommended levels[^4], should put wage increases into variable wage components, and transfer part of fixed wages to variable wage components as needed.
7.	A flexible wage structure enables employers to make quick adjustments during periods of economic uncertainty to sustain their businesses. At the same time, the FWS will provide greater job security for employees as companies can cut costs rather than cut jobs, and also allow wages to be more quickly restored in tandem with business recovery. Employers can refer to the FWS Guidebook, which can be accessed at https://go.gov.sg/fwsguidebook, for more information. Employers who need advice and support on implementing the FWS may approach the National Trades Union Congress (“NTUC”) and its affiliated unions, the Singapore National Employers Federation (“SNEF”), and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (“TAFEP”). The NWC also encourages trade associations and chambers and unions to support their members to adopt the FWS.
### Pressing on with Sustained Wage Growth for Lower-Wage Workers (LWWs)
8.	We must press on with the national effort to uplift LWWs so that our social compact remains strong and no worker is left behind even as Singapore progresses. In October 2020, the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers (TWG-LWW) recommended a renewed Progressive Wage strategy to uplift our LWWs over this decade, in a way that maximises their employment outcomes, and is also sustainable for businesses. Since then, the first set of Progressive Wage moves has been implemented in September 2022, with the second set to be implemented from March 2023.[^5] To support employers as they raise the wages of LWWs, the Government has also introduced a five-year $3.5 billion Progressive Wage Credit Scheme6 to co-fund wage increases for LWWs. The scheme will soften the cost impact to business and consumers in the near term. It will also give employers time to invest in upskilling employees and improve firm-level productivity so that the wage increases are sustainable in the long term.
