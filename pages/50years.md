## 1972
In 1972, the National Wages Council was convened as a tripartite advisory body on wage adjustments. Held at the Economic Development Board's office in the Fullerton Building, the first Council meeting was attended by representatives from the unions, employer groups, and the government.

The inaugural meeting established a key guiding principle - imporant decisions must be made unanimously. This principle continues to be the bedrock of tripartite partnership today.

## 1985
Singapore's first post-independence recession in 1985 exposed the shortcomings of a wage system that could not be adjusted quickly in tough economic times. As a result, many companies resorted to retrenchment. In 1986, the National Wages Council recommended the adoption of a Flexible Wage System, which has the Annual Variable Component as a wage element that could be cut if necessary to save jobs.

## 1999
In 1999, the Monthly Variable Component was also introduced to reduce wage costs promptly.

## 2012
The National Wages Council believes that the fruit of economic growth should be enjoyed by all Singaporeans. Since 2012, the Council has given special consideration to lower-wage workers by recommending quantitative wage increases for them.

## 2021
In 2021, the council set out the first of its annual guidance on the range of Progressive Wage growth to uplift lower-wage workers.
