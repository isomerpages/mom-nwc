### **Wage Outlook** <a name="wage-outlook"></a>

#####	What is the current wage outlook? <a name="1"></a>

  * For the rest of the year, resident employment should continue to expand alongside continuing economic recovery. In 2022, demand for resident and   non-resident workers will rise further as the economy expands at an above-trend pace. As labour market slack dissipates and foreign labour supply gradually normalises, resident wage growth is anticipated to strengthen. 
<br><br>

### **Regarding the Guidelines** <a name="regarding-the-guidelines"></a>

#####	What are the key areas of focus in the NWC Guidelines? <a name="2"></a>

  * There are three key areas of focus: 
    1.	First, wage guidelines. The 2021/2022 Guidelines focuses primarily on the economic recovery, and therefore a restoration of wage cuts and rolling back of cost-saving measures implemented earlier. However, recognising the unevenness of the recovery, the Guidelines also provide flexibility for employers that continue to be adversely impacted. The Guidelines also emphasise the adoption of the Flexible Wage System to enhance resilience.
    2.	Second, the NWC has provided Progressive Wage growth guidelines for the first time. This new role for the NWC was one of the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers (TWG-LWW). 
    3.	Third, training and transformation. To ensure sustainable wage growth, the NWC has called on tripartite partners to take decisive steps to transform jobs and upskill the workforce.

#####	How did the NWC arrive at these recommendations? What were some of the considerations? What were the key or most difficult issues in the negotiations? <a name="3"></a> 

  *	The 2021/2022 Guidelines are drafted in the context of an economic recovery, and hence, focuses primarily on the restoration of wage cuts and rolling back of cost-saving measures implemented during the onset of COVID-19. However, the NWC also recognised the unevenness of the recovery. Hence, the Guidelines also provide flexibility for employers that continue to be adversely impacted. 
  *	For the first time, the NWC will provide Progressive Wage growth guidelines. This new role for the NWC was one of the recommendations of the TWG-LWW. In arriving at the Progressive Wage growth recommendations, the tripartite partners had to balance the need to meaningfully uplift LWW wages so that they can gain ground on the median worker, as well as to allow flexibility for some sectors and employers that continue to face economic uncertainty and headwinds. 
  *	However, there was strong conviction among tripartite partners to uplift LWWs, and for all members of society to play their part in achieving this. As a result, the tripartite partners were able to reach a consensus.

### **Recovering Employers** <a name="recovering-employers"></a> 

#####	What is the NWC’s definition of ‘employers that have recovered or are recovering’? How should companies assess if they are in this category? <a name="4"></a>

  *	These companies were previously adversely impacted by COVID-19 (e.g. they might have experienced a significant fall in revenue or profits), but are now no longer impacted or impacted to a smaller extent. Companies should assess whether they are recovering based on their own business KPIs, performance and outlook, and share the financial information with Unions, where applicable. 

#####	Do the Guidelines allow companies that have implemented wage freezes or wage cuts to continue to do so? How much of wages can employers temporarily cut if they continue to be adversely impacted? <a name="5"></a> 

  *	Employers that continue to be impacted by COVID-19 should continue to tap on government support measures such as the Productivity Solutions Grant to accelerate business and workforce transformation, consider non-wage cost-saving measures as far as possible and endeavour to pay the Annual Wage Supplement. 
  *	If they have exhausted these measures but still face significant cost pressures and poor business prospects, they should then seek unions’ or employees’ support (where applicable) to implement further temporary wage cuts to the extent needed to minimise retrenchments.

#####	What are the expected Government support measures for employers that continue to be adversely impacted? Since the recovery is uneven across industries, will there be more industry-specific support? <a name="6"></a> 

  *	The Government is mindful that some sectors, such as aviation- and tourism-related industries, will take more time to recover. For these sectors, we will continue to take a more customised approach, in order to preserve core capabilities and talent. 
  *	The Government stands ready to support all Singaporeans to tide through this crisis and emerge stronger. As our economy recovers, we will continually recalibrate our support based on each sector’s specific needs and recovery trajectory, to ensure that our measures are targeted and achieve good value for money outcomes. The most-affected sectors such as Food & Beverage Services, Retail and Hotels have also rolled out Job Redesign Reskilling programmes with WSG’s assistance. They are using the downtime to train and upskill existing workers to take on redesigned and enhanced job roles, as part of their industry transformation. We have reskilled and redeployed close to 9,000 workers through these programmes. 

#####	Will MOM be investigating companies that might have conducted prolonged wage cuts and assessing if those sustained cuts are reasonable? <a name="7"></a>

  *	To ensure cost-saving measures implemented were reasonable and fair, MOM/TAFEP had proactively engaged more than 900 employers employing close to 56,000 affected employees whose salary reductions appeared to be excessive based on the tripartite advisories. About 330 of them had agreed to review their measures; while the remaining employers were able to justify the necessity of cost-saving measures for business survival. 
  *	MOM also reached out to employees who felt that their employers’ cost-saving measures were unreasonable or unfair. Through MOM’s intervention which included assessing fairness of employers’ cost-saving measures, the vast majority of employers were able to resolve their disputes amicably with the employees who had lodged complaints initially; with one in five employers also providing better salary support to their employees after MOM’s intervention.

### **Lower Wage Workers** <a name="lower-wage-workers"></a> 

#####	Why has the salary threshold of those considered lower-wage workers (LWWs) changed to $2,000 in gross monthly wage? <a name="8"></a> 

  *	The NWC has taken reference from the recommendations by the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower Wage Workers, which consider LWWs as those earning a gross monthly income from work up to the 20th percentile income level of full-time employed residents, which was about $2,000 in June 2020.

#####	How will the Government support employers, particularly those that are still recovering, with the costs of providing more significant wage increment to lower wage workers? <a name="9"></a> 

  *	In response to the recommendations by the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower Wage Workers, the Government is looking into transitional support for employers, with more details to be announced in due course.

#####	Can we expect the wage increases in the Food Services, Retail Progressive Wage Models (PWMs) to be in line with the NWC’s recommendations? <a name="10"></a> 

  *	Tripartite Clusters that are setting the wage rungs for their respective sectoral Progressive Wages, including the Food Services and Retail PWMs, should take reference from the NWC’s recommended Progressive Wage Growth. 
  *	At the same time, both sectors are significantly affected by COVID-19. The Tripartite Clusters will therefore also need to take into consideration their sectors’ unique business and job circumstances in setting the wage increases for their PWM.

#####	Will the Local Qualifying Salary (LQS) be increased in line with the NWC’s recommendations? <a name="11"></a> 

  *	The Government has increased the LQS annually since 2017, with the exception of 2021.
  *	However, the Government recognises that the new LQS requirement in 2022 will have significant impact on employers. Hence, we have no plans to further increase for now but will focus on the implementation of the new LQS rules.
  *	The Government will take into account locals’ wage trends and economic conditions, as well as the need to continue to uplift LWWs’ wages when reviewing LQS.

#####	Can a firm covered by the PWM reduce wages below the PWM wage rungs through the Flexible Wage System, in order to save jobs? <a name="12"></a> 

  *	The need to reduce wages to below PWM wage rungs has not been an issue so far. Even at the height of COVID-19, the Tripartite Clusters did not reduce PWM wages.
  *	The NWC has recommended that employers implementing a general policy of wage reduction should implement a wage freeze instead for lower-wage workers earning a monthly gross wage of $2,000 and below.
  *	Nonetheless, we recognise that there may be instances where employers need to reduce wages to save jobs. The Tripartite Clusters that oversee the respective PWMs can provide guidance on implementing the Flexible Wage System in their sectors.
<br><br>

### **Implementation** <a name="implementation"></a>

#####	How does NWC track the implementation and take-up of the wage-related recommendations, particularly the adoption of the Flexible Wage System? <a name="13"></a>

  *	MOM conducts the annual Survey on Annual Wage Changes to understand employers’ employment and contracting practices. This includes information on employers’ adoption of the NWC’s wage-related recommendations, and the inclusion of the Monthly Variable Component and Annual Wage Supplement in employees’ wage structure. 

#####	Will employers who do not implement the NWC recommendations be penalised? <a name="14"></a>

  *	The NWC Guidelines are recommendations to guide employers so that both employer and employees can benefit. As such, employers are encouraged to implement the recommendations.
  *	For employers that encounter difficulties in the implementation of the Guidelines, the NWC encourages these employers to work with employers’ associations and unions to address their issues.
  *	For workers covered by the sectoral PWMs, employers must continue to implement Progressive Wages in order to meet licensing conditions.  From September 2022, employers that do not pay Progressive Wages or the Local Qualifying Wages to applicable workers will be asked by MOM to do so. The failure to rectify will eventually lead to employers not being able to apply for new Work Passes or renew their existing Work Passes.

##### What is the current adoption of the Flexible Wage System (FWS)? What does the NWC intend to do to increase the adoption of FWS? <a name="15"></a>

  *	Based on latest available data, 31.4% of employees had both the Monthly Variable Component (MVC) and Annual Variable Component (AVC) in their wage structure in 2020, which was a slight increase from 29.1%  in 2019. [If asked] In 2020, 0.7% of employees had only the MVC in their wage structure, 56.9% had only the AVC, and 11.0% had neither the MVC nor the AVC. As shared previously in the 2020/2021 Supplementary Guidelines, in 2019, 0.3% of employees had only the MVC in their wage structure, 60.7% had only the AVC, and 9.8% had neither the MVC nor the AVC.
  *	The tripartite partners have been working together to promote and support adoption of the FWS through multiple touchpoints such as workshops, webinars and small-group clinics. We are also working with the HR industry such as the Singapore Human Resources Institute (SHRI) and the Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) to build capabilities of HR professionals in implementing FWS. We are glad to see an increasingly level of interest from employers and HR professionals on the FWS.   
  *	The NWC urges all employers to urgently implement the FWS if they have not already done so. A flexible and competitive wage structure will enable employers to make quick adjustments during periods of economic uncertainty. At the same time, the FWS will provide greater job security for employees and ensure that wages are fairly and more quickly restored in tandem with business recovery.
  *	For advice and support on implementing the FWS, employers may refer to the FWS Guidebook which we have released alongside the NWC 2021/2022 Guidelines. Employers may also approach NTUC and its affiliated unions, SNEF, and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).

#####	Did the NWC seek public feedback as part of its deliberations? What are some of the public feedback received by NWC? <a name="16"></a>

  *	The NWC Secretariat sought feedback from the public from 3 to 14 September during the deliberations.
  *	Feedback was received in two broad areas - (a) wage and wage-related employment practices, and (b) training. Issues and suggestions included wage restoration where possible, and training opportunities even amidst cost-cutting measures. 
  *	The feedback received have been incorporated into the published guidelines.

#####	How does the Council ensure that its guidelines remain relevant to employers? <a name="17"></a>

  *	The NWC guidelines are arrived at through tripartite consultation and consensus involving the employers, employees and Government’s representatives. Such consensus building helps to ensure the guidelines are robust and practical, and to facilitate the adoption and implementation of the guidelines.
  *	Hence, there is strong commitment from the tripartite partners to implement the NWC Guidelines. This has been a hallmark of the NWC’s achievements. 

#####	Do the NWC Guidelines (including the PW recommendations) apply to foreign employees? <a name="18"></a>

  *	Employers are encouraged to take the NWC Guidelines into consideration while making wage adjustments for their foreign employees.
<br><br>

### **Job Redesign** <a name="job-redesign"></a> 

#####	Why should employers do job redesign? What support is there for employers that wish to embark on job redesign and how can employers apply? <a name="19"></a>

  *	Job redesign supports employers’ business transformation journey by ensuring that jobs are transformed to make the most of new technology or business processes, and that employers acquire the skills to perform well in these jobs. Job redesign therefore enables employers to achieve productivity gains. This can help employers gain a competitive edge today and be better prepared to seize new opportunities when the economy recovers.
  *	The Productivity Solutions Grant for Job Redesign (“PSG-JR”) provides support for job redesign consultancy services. The JR consultants will guide employers to redesign work processes, tasks, duties and responsibilities of relevant job roles based on employers’ business transformation needs.
  *	At the same time, employees can be reskilled and upskilled to take on better jobs with higher wages. This makes jobs more attractive for employees, and they in turn are more likely to stay and grow with businesses. PSG-JR can therefore result in win-win benefits for both employers and employees.
<br><br>

### **Public Sector** <a name="public-sector"></a> 

#####	How do the 2021/2022 Guidelines affect the public sector’s wage adjustments, including the mid-year and year-end payments? <a name="20"></a>

  *	Earlier this year, civil servants received a mid-year AVC of 0.3 months in recognition of the improvements in our economic prospects, while bearing in mind the uncertainties surrounding our nation’s economic recovery. Civil servants in junior grades also received an additional one-off lump sum payment of $350 to $700, with those in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, and the Operations Support Scheme (OSS) Grades III to V receiving the higher payment.
  *	In line with the NWC’s call to ensure sustained wage growth for LWWs, the Civil Service will continue to adopt a progressive approach determining the wage adjustments for civil servants. For our lower-wage officers, PSD and the relevant agencies will also continue to engage the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) and other public sector unions on ways to uplift their wages sustainably, such as through job redesign to equip them with enhanced skills that can command a higher pay. 
  *	In addition to taking reference from the NWC’s guidelines, the Public Service will continue to monitor the prevailing economic and labour market conditions when deciding on salary adjustments for 2021/2022. The mid-year and year-end payments will also be decided in close consultation with the public sector unions.

#####	Will the Public Service be showing special consideration to lower-wage officers through variable payments or built-in wage increments? <a name="21"></a>

  *	The Government remains committed to uplifting the wages of LWWs, including our lower-wage officers. For instance, in recent years, the Civil Service has taken a progressive approach with the mid-year and year-end payments by ensuring that in general, officers in more junior grades receive lump sum payments that comprise a larger number of months of their salary compared to those in the more senior grades. 
  *	At the same time, we conduct regular salary reviews and make adjustments where necessary, to ensure that salaries are market competitive. For our lower-wage officers, PSD and the relevant agencies will continue to engage the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) on ways to uplift their wages sustainably, such as through job redesign to equip them with enhanced skills that can command a higher pay.

#####	Will the Public Service show special consideration to public officers who have been on the frontlines of Singapore’s fight against the pandemic (e.g., teachers, healthcare workers)? <a name="22"></a>

  *	Since last year, the public sector stepped up and worked exceptionally hard to fight COVID-19. This includes officers on the frontlines such as public healthcare workers, teachers, and those deployed to support various COVID-19 operations, as well as those who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to roll out support schemes for citizens and businesses, and those who scoured the world to secure our supplies of food and essential items, including vaccines.  
  *	The Public Service will continue to recognise the efforts and contributions of officers in different ways, including through the annual performance appraisal process and other forms of awards.
