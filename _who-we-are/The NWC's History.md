> "The spirit of tripartite partnership was fostered and strengthened over the years through the National Wages Council... This is a unique system which has served us well and has been our competitive advantage. We should not take the co-operation for granted. We should preserve and strengthen this valuable institution so that can continue to benefit business, workers/unions and the economy." - **Mr Lee Kuan Yew** 

* **The late 1960s and early 1970s were a time when Singapore was undergoing a period of rapid industrialisation, which had resulted in rising wage expectations.** There were concerns that high wage expectations would lead to serious industrial disputes, which could dampen the investment climate and adversely affect the economic progress of Singapore.

* **In the past, wage and benefit negotiations were carried out by individual trade unions with companies in which its members were employed.** Such collective bargaining between the two parties would lead to the signing of a collective agreement that would spell out the terms and conditions of service of employee, the benefits they would enjoy, the wages they would get and how much increase they would be entitled to each year. How the agreements  turned out often depended on the bargaining strengths of both parties and the ability and willingness of the employer to pay. There was little regard for the bigger picture of economic sustainability.

* **The NWC was thus set up to formulate wage guidelines to be in line with long-term economic growth, so that Singaporeâ€™s economic and social development would not be undermined.**
