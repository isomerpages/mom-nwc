## The NWC recommends that employers implement training and productivity initiatives

Employers are encouraged to work with NTUC to establish **Company Training Committees (“CTCs”)**. The CTCs have helped companies in **driving business transformation to increase productivity** and **implementing training plans**, and can tap into the wider NTUC training and placement ecosystem, which includes NTUC’s e2i. The Government has also set aside $70 million for the NTUC CTC Grant to support employers to implement transformation plans.

To ensure skills currency, employers should adopt a **proactive** approach to **reskill and upskill existing employees** to prepare them for changes in job functions. Employers and employees can refer to SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)’s quarterly [Jobs and Skills Insights Reports](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/jobs-skills), as well as the [*Skills Demand for the Future Economy*](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/-/media/Skills-Report-2021/Skills-Report-Documents-FINAL/SSG-Skills_Demand_for_the_Future_Economy_2021.pdf) report published in December 2021 to learn about emerging trends, growth areas and in-demand skills.

Employers can also tap on **Government subsidies** to reskill and upskill employees, e.g., [Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programmes](https://www.wsg.gov.sg/programmes-and-initiatives/career-conversion-programmes-employers.html) which provide up to 90% of monthly salary for training duration. Individuals can also tap on the [SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/enhancedsubsidy), which provides subsidies of up to 90% of course fees for SSG-supported courses.

Employers can also seek the assistance of SNEF, Singapore Business Federation (“SBF”), other trade associations & chambers, the unions and NTUC LearningHub, access consultancy services offered by the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (“NACE”), or join a [SkillsFuture Queen Bee network](https://www.enterprisejobskills.gov.sg/content/upgrade-skills/skillsfuture-queen-bee-networks.html) in their sector where available to raise their capability and capacity for training their own workers. SNEF has a variety of training courses for employers to consider; click [here](https://snef.org.sg/training/programmes-courses/) to find out more.

Employers should also recognise and support the acquisition and demonstration of skills in decisions affecting hiring and career advancements.


### Training requirements from March 2023

Employers are required to ensure that all resident OPW employees attain either:
<ol>
<li>One Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) course, with no restriction on which course can be taken, or;</li>
<li>One in-house training programme</li>
<ul>   
<li>An in-house training programme refers to a training programme organised by employers themselves and guided by defined training objectives, training modality, key training tasks, and training duration.</li>
<li>Where required, employers should be prepared to show supporting documentation on the in-house training programme – (i) defined training objectives, (ii) training modality, (iii) key training tasks, (iv) training duration (e.g. no. of days) – and records of specific workers undergoing the training.</li>
<li>On-the-job training can be counted towards in-house training programme requirement, as long as it fulfils the criteria set out above.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
  
Employers will be given a grace period to comply with the OPW training requirements:
 <ol>
  <li>For new hires, employers are to comply within a grace period of six months from the new hire’s date of employment.</li>
  <li>For existing employees, employers are given a grace period of one year from the start of the OPW implementation in March 2023 (i.e. up to 29 February 2024) to comply with the training requirement.</li>
</ol>
