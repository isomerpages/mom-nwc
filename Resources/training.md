### Training requirements from March 2023
Employers are required to ensure that all resident OPW employees attain either:
  1. One Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) course, with no restriction on which course can be taken, or;
  2. One in-house training programme
    • An in-house training programme refers to a training programme organised by employers themselves and guided by defined training objectives, training modality, key training tasks, and training duration.
    • Where required, employers should be prepared to show supporting documentation on the in-house training programme – (i) defined training objectives, (ii) training modality, (iii) key training tasks, (iv) training duration (e.g. no. of days) – and records of specific workers undergoing the training.
    • On-the-job training can be counted towards in-house training programme requirement, as long as it fulfils the criteria set out above.

Employers will be given a grace period to comply with the OPW training requirements:
 <ol>
  <li>For new hires, employers are to comply within a grace period of six months from the new hire’s date of employment.</li>
  <li>For existing employees, employers are given a grace period of one year from the start of the OPW implementation in March 2023 (i.e. up to 29 February 2024) to comply with the training requirement.</li>
</ol>
