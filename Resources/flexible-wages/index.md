The flexible wage system has 2 components: the **Monthly Variable Component (MVC)** and the **Annual Variable Component (AVC)**.

- The MVC is part of your basic monthly salary, and may be adjusted based on the financial situation as indicated by various KPI.
- The AVC is directly linked to the company’s annual performance and varies directly with its operating and/or financial performance. It includes:
  - **Variable Bonuses**, which reward employees for meeting productivity or performance targets and are usually offered at the end of the company’s financial year
  - **Other Variable Payments**, rewarding employees for their contributions to short-term goals (e.g. new product launch, project completion, operational improvements) and are given monthly or quarterly
  - **Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) or 13th-Month Bonus**, which is a single annual payment typically given at the end of the calendar or financial year
