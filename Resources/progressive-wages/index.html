### What is the Progressive Wage Model?

The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) helps to uplift lower wage workers' wages, mapping out a clear career pathway for their wages to rise along with training and improvements in productivity and standards. Higher productivity improves business profits for employers, and service buyers also enjoy better service standards and quality.

The PWM covers Singapore citizens and Singapore permanent residents (PRs) in cleaning, security, landscape, lift and escalator and retail job roles.

Find out more about the PWM on the [MOM website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/progressive-wage-model).
